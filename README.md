# SID
MCMC algorithm for fitting transmission parameters in SID Diarrhea model 

There are two R scripts. MCMC_V1.R fits the model with water contabmintion. MCMC_V0.R fits the model without water contamination. mvtnorm Package should be installed.

Based on the paper "Modeling Household Transmission Dynamics: Application to Diarrheal Disease in Central Africa" by Woroszylo et al. (2018).
